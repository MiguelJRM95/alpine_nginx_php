# alpine_nginx_php

### A simple server to run php files store in the host machine 
### in case don't want to setup the environment

# use docker run -p 'hostPort':8080 -v 'absolutPathInHost':/var/www/html 

### I use this mainly for my higher education modules in which I need to programming in PHP
